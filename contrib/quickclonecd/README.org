#+title: quickclonecd

=,clonecd teodorlu/shed= - git clone teodorlu/shed into ~/dev/teodorlu/shed, and cd into it.

Target: one shell function wrapping one Clojure function.

** status
I have a /python/ binary that I call from a shell function.
I don't want to take a too large step.

Here's a plan:

1. Keep the python script as-is
2. Wrap it in with babashka
3. Pick out the last line of the output
4. Shellexec that line.

Then I can:

1. Call the clone functionality from Clojure
2. Experiment with my shellexec bash code.
3. Delete some messy bash code.
